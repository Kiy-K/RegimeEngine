Exhaustion dynamics.

Exhaustion is the only macro variable evolved by its own ODE rather than
derived algebraically.  It accumulates during high volatility / instability
episodes and recovers during calm periods:

    dExh/dt = α_Exh · [V · I · (1 − Exh) − β_Exh · (1 − V) · (1 − I) · Exh]

Stability proof:
  - When Exh = 1:
        dExh/dt = α_Exh · [V·I·0 − β_Exh·(1−V)·(1−I)·1] ≤ 0
    (growth term vanishes; recovery term is non-positive) → cannot exceed 1.
  - When Exh = 0:
        dExh/dt = α_Exh · V · I · 1 ≥ 0 → cannot go below 0.

At high exhaustion the system approaches a frozen state: all faction ODEs are
gated by (1 − Exh) → 0 except memory (which is intentionally ungated).
